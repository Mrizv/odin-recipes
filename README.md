# odin-recipes

Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

The current project is a recipe project that will use all of the HTML knowledge I have discovered up until now.
The skills I will have demonstrated are creating directories, creating HTML files, implementing images, and describing a recipe using ordered and unordered lists.
